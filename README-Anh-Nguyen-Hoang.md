The exercise looks like a notification of a social network to me, which we show different types of actions to users.

There're always several approaches to an issue.

1. We can display by type: Loan & Till. We might design a selection box somewhere to allow user to select between loan and till. Then they can use the slider to browse all inbox regarding the type they care. 
2. We can display both loan & till in timestamp sequence, which simpler to user regarding UI/UX (compare to 1). The downside, of course, I think is that we have separating API(s) for loan and till. Since every query needs a limit for performance, the list might not be in exact timestamp sequence as real life. 

For me, second to go, of course, it looks simpler to user and similar to other social networks. If need be, we can make a separating page with a table/list that we can filter for action type we want, more detailed, stats, etc...
